      <h4>How I Ended Up in an IT Course Despite My Parents Wanting A Doctor</h4>

        <i><u>When did your interest in IT start? </u></i><br>
        The interest in IT most likely began for me when my brother and I received our first piece of technology for our own use, the iPod Touch in 2009 and kickstarted the integration of technology into the daily lives of people. I began to become interested with the idea of becoming a game developer thanks to watching YouTube videos such as DidYouKnowGaming providing interesting factoids about game development which led to my first attempts in learning how to program games (although quite unsuccessfully). Later when I entered Year 10, electives were provided and I chose to do Computing as a subject, which gave me my first experience of Python as well as learning to use VisualBasic to develop software UI. This would then lead to me taking up Computing and Software Development as VCE subjects. From my experiences so far, I consider myself enjoying the more design orientated aspects of developing software such as UI as well as the approach and application of cybersecurity in the current state of the world. <br>

        <i><u>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</u></i><br>
        RMIT was one of the two recommended universities advised to me by my career’s counsellor back in high school if I wanted to pursue a career in Information Technology as they integrated work experience into the courses during your study. What made RMIT more appealing than the other option was the location of campus that made it much more accessible, as having commute times of only 40 minutes was an improvement for my wellbeing. Additionally, having the campus be set in the heart of Melbourne city meant lots of opportunities would present itself in the future, which is nice.  <br>
        <br>
        <i><u>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</u></i><br>
        As of writing this, at the end of Week 2, I expect my studies to place less emphasis on the technical skills needed to excel at a job in the field of Information technology, but rather the skills to be able to work in a group setting, whether it be working in teams or interacting with the users in order to design a better software solution. Additionally, I expect some curveballs to be thrown during the coursework, as I highly doubt any software was ever developed to the last detail of its design, so it’d be interesting to learn strategies to deal with the unexpected. <br>
