      <h4>How I Ended Up in an IT Course Despite My Parents Wanting A Doctor</h4>

        <i><u>When did your interest in IT start? </u></i><br>
        The interest in IT most likely began for me when my brother and I received our first piece of technology for our own use, the iPod Touch in 2009 and kickstarted the integration of technology into the daily lives of people. I began to become interested with the idea of becoming a game developer thanks to watching YouTube videos such as DidYouKnowGaming providing interesting factoids about game development which led to my first attempts in learning how to program games (although quite unsuccessfully). Later when I entered Year 10, electives were provided and I chose to do Computing as a subject, which gave me my first experience of Python as well as learning to use VisualBasic to develop software UI. This would then lead to me taking up Computing and Software Development as VCE subjects. From my experiences so far, I consider myself enjoying the more design orientated aspects of developing software such as UI as well as the approach and application of cybersecurity in the current state of the world. <br>
        <br>
        <i><u>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</u></i><br>
        RMIT was one of the two recommended universities advised to me by my career’s counsellor back in high school if I wanted to pursue a career in Information Technology as they integrated work experience into the courses during your study. What made RMIT more appealing than the other option was the location of campus that made it much more accessible, as having commute times of only 40 minutes was an improvement for my wellbeing. Additionally, having the campus be set in the heart of Melbourne city meant lots of opportunities would present itself in the future, which is nice.  <br>
        <br>
        <i><u>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</u></i><br>
        As of writing this, at the end of Week 2, I expect my studies to place less emphasis on the technical skills needed to excel at a job in the field of Information technology, but rather the skills to be able to work in a group setting, whether it be working in teams or interacting with the users in order to design a better software solution. Additionally, I expect some curveballs to be thrown during the coursework, as I highly doubt any software was ever developed to the last detail of its design, so it’d be interesting to learn strategies to deal with the unexpected. <br>

        <b>Description:</b> This job entails working at a company focused on developing software dedicated to improving customer service online and allow clients to understand their customers needs more accurately. In this specific job, it would be joining the team for developing Sandbox, one of Zendesk’s products for clients to test their software isolated from production and involves adding new features, reconfiguring old features and pushing new features. This position appeals to me based on how many benefits the job offers and the salary for it, ensuring a decent amount of money for me to enjoy in my own free time as well as offering Health Insurance and Remote Work options on top of only an 8-hour shift, which I consider important for work-life balance as commute is a huge detractor for me. As well, the option for professional development assistance and referral programs means that I can continue to grow professionally instead of stagnating and keep up to date with newer technologies and ensure I can find work under other companies if need be. Lastly, working on projects that directly involve customers give me satisfaction if the client is happy with the result, meaning the work I do is beneficial to someone. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Requirements:</b> The job expects any applicants to have a strong technical background that includes knowing JavaScript in-depth, such as tools as NPM, Yarn and Webpack, an understanding of technical trends in JavaScript and browser space, building robust and reliable user interfaces and browsers, and working with Engineering and Product teams to deliver products. The employer would also show preference to individuals who have skills in working with custom front-end frameworks or modular delivery and experience in one or more server-side languages on top of having a bachelor’s degree and at least a year of experience in Software Development and Information & Communications Technology Occupation. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Current Skills:</b> My current skill sets only encompass relatively amateur levels of Python in terms of software development languages and only experience of software development being developing a small project for a one-person client for VCE. I have limited experience in working with customers stemming from my work experience placement under my local council working with community members. I am currently working my way towards getting my Bachelor of Information Technology degree as well. <br>
