        <i><u>Media Production</u></i><br>
        The creation of movies and videos began with watching media analysis videos on YouTube which gradually developed into an interest in understanding media production and learning about techniques and movies that employed them. I took Media as one of my VCE 3/4 subjects which I enjoyed thoroughly and I still enjoy learning about techniques ranging from choreography, choices of music, screenwriting and acting. <br>
        <br>
        <i><u>History</u></i><br>
        Ever since watching Horrible Histories as a child, I enjoyed learning about history about people rather than the greats, preferring to read about diets and past times historic people had. The only formal area of study Iâ€™ve done for history is the French and Russian Revolutions for VCE, but otherwise I enjoy learning a great deal about every other period on Earth, ranging from the early Bronze Age civilisations to the recent formation of South Sudan as the newest country in the world.<br>
        <br>
        <i><u>Anime and History</u></i><br>
        I started off watching Anime due to my brother getting his hands on bootlegged copies of Naruto and reading Dragon Ball in the manga sections of bookstores, which gradually expanded to interests in Japan as a whole, especially in history. My favourite manga series as of now currently is Bungou Stray Dogs.
